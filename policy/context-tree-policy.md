## Context Tree Policy

### What A Context Tree Is

The Context Tree is durable context, not a source-code mirror, wiki dump, or
task log. It records current decisions, constraints, ownership, and
cross-domain relationships with enough rationale that a future reader does
not have to reconstruct them from GitHub PRs, chat logs, or tribal knowledge.

### Source-System Boundary

The tree records **what was decided and why**; source repos record **how it is
implemented**. If information would rot when the next refactor lands, it does
not belong in the tree.

| Belongs in the tree | Stays in the source repo |
| --- | --- |
| A choice between alternatives and why the alternatives lost | Function signatures, types, class hierarchies |
| A constraint that shapes future implementation across repos | Step-by-step implementation walkthroughs |
| An ownership change or clarified review path | API request / response shapes |
| A current constraint that resulted from a deprecation | Test fixtures, snapshot data, build / CI config |
| A new relationship between two domains | Bug fixes that do not change a public contract |
| Rationale that would not be obvious from the diff alone | Refactors that preserve behaviour |
| A decision as it stands today: current state + present-tense rationale | Historical narrative of how we got here |

### Content Classes And Authority

- **Normal content** — root/domain `NODE.md` and regular domain leaves. It states current durable truth; when a decision changes, rewrite or remove old claims.
- **Archive/supporting content** — proposals, meetings, explorations, and raw material such as `raw-context/`. It is evidence, not canonical truth: read it only when asked, when the source is archive/proposal material, or when the task needs archive context. Normal content must not require this class.
- **Member content** — responsibility, ownership, and review scope such as `members/<id>/NODE.md`. Use it to route or validate *Who*, not as a substitute for normal decision/constraint nodes.

### Code vs Tree Drift Authority

Normal tree content is authoritative for durable context, but not a blind
override for observed source reality. By default, **code is the ground truth**
when the tree and code disagree: treat the tree as drifted and update the tree
from source-backed evidence. `decisionLocksCode: true` reverses that default
for one node: the tree wins, and code drift escalates to a human owner instead
of being silently fixed or ignored. Set or rely on that flag only on explicit
user or host-framework authorization.

### The Double Test

Before writing, apply both questions to every candidate fact:

1. **Decision test.** Does this source establish or change something a future
   agent must respect when making cross-domain choices?
2. **Durability test.** If the triggering commit or GitHub PR were rewritten, would
   the decision still stand?

The candidate belongs in the tree only when both answers are yes. Failing the
decision test means the source is implementation detail; failing the
durability test means the source captures how something was done this time,
not what was decided.

### Content Model: What / Why / Who

- **What** — the decision, design choice, or constraint as it stands today.
  Write the durable claim, not implementation detail or a timeline of prior
  states.
- **Why** — the surviving rationale: constraints that won, alternatives that
  lost, and design course-corrections translated into present-tense reasoning.
  Capture **why**, not only what. Design-phase chat, review, and meeting
  threads are where this rationale is produced: somebody flags a constraint,
  a first proposal is corrected, or an option conflicts with another domain.
  The node records the surviving constraint and reasoning from those moments,
  not the chronology. A node without rationale is a fact, not a decision record.
- **Who** — ownership, carried by `owners` frontmatter and
  member content. Do not put ownership in the body, and do not unilaterally
  edit `owners`.

### Add vs Edit

Default to editing an existing node. A node earns its existence by being
independently findable, ownable, or linkable; otherwise edit the existing
node. Add a leaf only when all three hold:

1. **Distinct identity** — a noun-phrase title that does not overlap any
   sibling.
2. **Distinct anchor** — at least one of: different `owners`; another domain
   would `soft_links` to this specific decision; or the source naturally has
   its own Decision / Rationale / Constraints that cannot co-live with an
   existing leaf.
3. **Passes the Double Test.**

Add a directory only when at least three cohesive leaves share an axis. New
top-level domains require explicit user or host-framework authorization. When
a decision touches two domains, keep canonical content in the more specific
domain and link from the broader one with normal-to-normal `soft_links` or
short prose.

### Node Shape

Required frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Short noun phrase"
owners: [alice, bob]
---
```

Useful optional frontmatter: `description`, `soft_links`,
`lastReviewed`, and `decisionLocksCode`. `lastReviewed` records an actual
owner review; update it only when that review is the concrete source for a
source-backed write. Use `owners: ["*"]` only when the user or host framework
explicitly opens ownership to everyone. Metadata supports scanning, routing,
and responsibility.

Prefer body sections in this order, omitting any that do not apply:
`Decision`, `Rationale`, `Constraints`, `Cross-Domain`. There is no
`Source`, `Provenance`, or `Shipped-in` section; PR, commit, and issue delivery
history lives in Git history and GitHub PR descriptions, not node prose.

### Write / Verify / GitHub PR Discipline

Default to not writing: a missing node is a question, a noisy node is a trap.
Source-backed writes require a concrete source artifact and surrounding context
(source, target, parent, relevant `soft_links`, ownership-adjacent member
content) unless already known. Actionable future work does not live in normal
tree content; put it in an issue, source artifact, or authorized decision
instead. `context-tree verify` must pass before any tree commit. Keep tree prose
current-state: no timeline, provenance, PR references, or implementation detail.
Every write starts from a freshly fetched base commit in an isolated clean
worktree, changes only necessary Markdown, passes verification, and is published
with a non-force task-branch push and GitHub PR. Never merge automatically. A
source-backed tree PR stays scoped to one source artifact so owner review and
rollback stay precise. An invalid base blocks semantic changes; only an explicit
repair request may produce a repair-only PR limited to validator findings.
